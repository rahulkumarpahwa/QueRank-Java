## 📈 Statistics Section

The page displays 4 key metrics at the bottom:

1. **Total Attempts** - Number of quiz attempts by all users
2. **Average Score** - Mean score across all attempts
3. **Average Percentage** - Mean percentage across all attempts
4. **Unique Users** - Count of distinct students

## 🚀 How to Use

### Access the Page:

1. **From Result Page:** After completing a quiz, click "View All Results" button
2. **Direct URL:** Visit `http://localhost:8080/QueRank/all-results`
3. **From Home:** Click "View All Results" in any navigation menu

### Navigation:

- **Home Button** - Returns to registration page
- **Take Quiz Button** - Starts a new quiz (when no results exist)
- All result rows are clickable and interactive

## 💻 Database Query

The servlet uses an optimized SQL query that:

- Joins Users, Results, and Companies tables
- Calculates percentage scores using formula: `(score * 100) / total_questions`
- Sorts by most recent attempts first
- Includes proper error handling

```sql
SELECT r.result_id, u.name, u.roll_number, u.email, c.company_name,
       r.score, r.total_questions, r.rank_assigned, r.attempted_at,
       ROUND((r.score * 100.0 / r.total_questions), 2) AS percentage
FROM Results r
JOIN Users u ON r.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Companies c ON r.company_id = c.company_id
ORDER BY r.attempted_at DESC
```

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile  
✅ **Performance Indicators** - Color-coded visual feedback

## 🧪 Testing

After implementation, test:

- ✓ Complete a quiz and verify results appear on all-results page
- ✓ Multiple quizzes show all results in table
- ✓ Statistics calculations are correct
- ✓ Color coding displays properly
- ✓ Navigation links work
- ✓ Responsive design on mobile
- ✓ Empty state displays when no results
- ✓ Database errors display gracefully

## 📝 Notes

- The page auto-updates with latest results from database
- No pagination implemented yet (can handle ~500-1000 results)
- For large datasets, consider adding pagination
- All SQL uses prepared statements for security
- Proper resource cleanup with try-finally blocks

## 🚦 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- Add pagination for large result sets
- Add filtering (by company, date, user)
- Add sorting (click column headers)
- Export to CSV/PDF functionality
- Add charts for visual analytics
- Create admin-only results dashboard
- Add date range filtering
